We aim to transform the transactional data into a customer-centric dataset by creating new features that will facilitate the segmentation of customers into distinct groups using the K-means clustering algorithm. 
This segmentation will allow us to understand the distinct profiles and preferences of different customer groups.

Objectives:
Data Cleaning & Transformation: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers, preparing it for effective clustering.
Feature Engineering: Develop new features based on the transactional data to create a customer-centric dataset, setting the foundation for customer segmentation.
Data Preprocessing: Undertake feature scaling and dimensionality reduction to streamline the data, enhancing the efficiency of the clustering process.
Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering: Segment customers into distinct groups using K-means, facilitating targeted marketing and personalized strategies.
Cluster Analysis & Evaluation: Analyze and profile each cluster to develop targeted marketing strategies and assess the quality of the clusters formed.
